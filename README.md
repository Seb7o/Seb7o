## 👋 Hi, I'm Seb (Seb7o)  

### 🏠 About Me  
I'm an individual contributor passionate about **homelabs, automation, and DevOps**. My GitHub primarily serves as an **archive for my personal projects**, which is why you might not see many public repositories—most of them are either:  
- Too specific to my personal needs  
- Related to specific projects  
- In a state that I don't consider clean or tested enough for public release  
- Unfinished  

My main project is my **homelab**, a playground where I learn, automate, and build solutions for things that existing tools don't solve (or not the way I want). I’ve also created various projects, including:  
- **Complex web scrapers** and automation tools  
- **Custom integrations for old tech** (e.g., controlling a 2000s Sony receiver via Home Assistant with an ESP8266 and Sony Control S protocol)  
- **Android apps**, like one for organizing small-group sports events and another for media requests  
- **A messenger bot** (pre-ChatGPT era) that automated content downloads  

### 🚀 Why I'm Sharing My Homelab  
Recently, I started documenting and sharing my homelab for three reasons:  
1. **Security** – Exposing infrastructure details forces me to improve security.  
2. **Helping Others** – Some friends are getting into homelabs, and I want to make it easier for them.  
3. **Professional Visibility** – It’s a great way to showcase my problem-solving and infrastructure design skills to recruiters.  

I'm also looking for potential collaborators, especially as my **streaming platform project** grows and demands more time.  

### ⚡ Notable Achievements  
These projects have taught me so much and strengthened my passion for **infrastructure, automation, and problem-solving**. More than anything, I want others to experience the same **self-satisfaction of growing a personal project**.  

### 📖 Skills Needed to Use/Contribute  
If you want to explore my projects, some **basic skills** will be helpful:  
- Linux fundamentals  
- Networking concepts  
- Basic programming knowledge  
- English (since most documentation is in English)

### 💬 Contributions & Suggestions  
I always welcome **ideas and feedback**, but keep in mind that these projects are built **for me, by me**, so not every suggestion will be relevant. **There’s no fixed roadmap**—homelabs are endless projects: adding something always creates new needs, which leads to more projects, and so on...
